Hi there, I'm Leonardo, a web developer currently working at the Municipal Secretary of Planning in Natal, Brazil. I'm also in my 6th semester of computer science studies at UNP.

I'm passionate about full-stack development, with a focus on technologies like Laravel for back-end development and React for front-end development. 

Apart from programming, I love philosophy and using scientific protocols for self-improvement.

I'm fluent in English and Portuguese
