# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I am a computer science student currently in my 5th semester at UNP. I am fluent in English, native in Portuguese, have intermediate proficiency in Spanish, and basic proficiency in Russian. My education and experience in computer science have allowed me to develop a diverse set of skills, including experience in a variety of programming languages and technologies, as well as some experience in web design.

Here is a summary of some of my notable projects:

- A gym management application written in Java and utilizing MySql for the database. The application allows for the management of functionaries, students, professors, and visitors, each with their own unique data types. The application has a user-friendly interface and is designed for ease of use.

- A web application that utilizes encryption for passwords and authentication with bcrypt and Oauth2 (with the module Passport). This application was made using Node.js and the Express.js framework, with Pug for adding extra functionality to the HTML. I have implemented responsive design for the website and optimized for best user experience

- A social network written in Python, using Django and Sqlite. The network allows users to see posts from the users they are following, and permits users to make new posts, delete previous posts, and update them. The social network has a clean and modern design, and it is optimized for fast performance.

- A store terminal application written in C++. The application uses the full CRUD, and allows users to save clients, functionaries, managers, and products. Managers have full administrative permissions, functionaries have some permissions, and clients can only see products. The application has a Command Line Interface, it is efficient and easy to use.

- An application for image manipulating written in C. The application takes a matrix of pixels and applies modifications to them, and then saves the new image according to the PPM standard. The application includes a variety of filters (blur, sharpen, border detection, and thresholding), as well as other transformations (reduce size, amplify, and rotation). The application is lightweight and efficient, it is perfect for editing images.

I have also completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology from Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia, which has helped me to broaden my skills and knowledge in the field.

Recently I have done a React and Typescript project of the front end design of a website using styled components, this project has allowed me to improve my skills in front-end development and design.
