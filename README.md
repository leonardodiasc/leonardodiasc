Howdy, welcome, this is Leonardo.

Computer science student currently in my 5th semester at UNP. 

I have completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology from Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia.

Currently learning full stack development, especially with technologies such as Laravel, Node.js, and .NET for back-end, and React for front-end.

Love philosophy and science based tools to improve myself.

Fluent in English, and Portuguese, with intermediary Greek.
