Hi there, I'm Leonardo, a web developer currently working at the Municipal Secretary of Planning in Natal, Brazil. I'm also in my 5th semester of computer science studies at UNP. I completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology from Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia, which helped me gain valuable experience in the industry.

I'm passionate about full-stack development, with a focus on technologies like Laravel, Node.js, and .NET for back-end development and React for front-end development. Apart from programming, I love philosophy and using scientific protocols for self-improvement.

I'm fluent in English and Portuguese, and I have an intermediary level of Greek.
