Howdy, welcome to my profile!

Computer science student currently in my 5th semester at UNP. I have also completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology from Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia, which has helped me to broaden my skills and knowledge in the field.

Learning Typescript, React, and React Native before anything else at the moment.

Fluent in English, and Portuguese, with intermediary Greek and Spanish.

Love philosophy and science based tools to improve myself.

Recently I have done a React and Typescript project of the front end design of a website using styled components, this project has allowed me to improve my skills in front-end development and design.
